Please find attached a script which consists in stripping the comments of a product in the Amazon site

As well as a script which cleans up the text using stop_words, Lemmatization, Normalization (accent, capitals ...)

I haven't finished this project yet, I'm still doing research on this area of NLP,

I am giving you the next steps I wanted to do:

   -> TF-IDF (consists in calculating the weight as well as the rarity of a word in the text)
   -> WORD2VEC
   -> FRENCH BERT

these are models which consists in making similitudes between words.
